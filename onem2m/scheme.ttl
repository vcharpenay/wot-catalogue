There could be an infinite number of possible functionalities, however it is recommended to identify a not-too-large selection of them as generic examples and allow for additional proprietary extensions. In a particular Domain there will be one Module for each of the agreed ModuleClasses plus additional ones for each extension of a ModuleClass.";

Manipulating DataPoints is the most common way of controlling devices. Each DataPoint has an associated type (e.g. simple integer/real numbers, string of text, struct, or arrays thereof) which facillitates data integrity. Note that all RESTful systems (e.g. CoAP) use only DataPoint operations, so the mapping of a data models using an SDT into RESTful applications is easy.";
